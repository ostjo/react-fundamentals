# Creating custom components

## 📝 Your Notes

### React.createElement()

`React.createElement()` can actually take in a function as a first argument. So
instead of creating elements like this:

```js
React.createElement('span', {children: 'Hello'})
```

... we can pass in a function like this:

```js
const message = ({children}) => <span>{children}</span>

React.createElement(message, {children: 'Hello'})
```

### Why are components written in uppercase?

Components are written in uppercase so that Babel recognizes the first argument
we pass to a `React.createElement()` call as a reference to a block-scope
variable.<br/>

> React.createElement('message', null, 'Hello')

### propTypes

If you'd like to check types of props without TypeScript, `propTypes` can be
used for runtime validation of types.

Say we have a custom `<Message/>` component that takes in `subject` and
`greeting` of type `string`:

```js
const Message = ({subject, greeting}) => (
  <div className="message">
    {greeting}, {subject}
  </div>
)
```

Then we can apply the following type checks:

```js
/* define a propType object with string type check */
const PropTypes = {
  string(props, propName, componentName) {
    if (typeof props[propName] !== 'string') {
      return new Error('Property of type string is required.')
    }
  },
}

/* assign the propTypes to Message's props */
Message.propTypes = {
  subject: PropTypes.string,
  greeting: PropTypes.string,
}
```

React also provides a [`prop-types`](https://npm.im/prop-types) package for the
most commonly used types.

It's a development-only feature, which means that when compiling for production,
Babel removes all those `propTypes` from the code – to prevent it from slowing
down our App's performance.

## Background

Just like in regular JavaScript, you often want to share code which you do using
functions. If you want to share JSX, you can do that as well. In React we call
these functions "components" and they have some special properties.

Components are basically functions which return something that is "renderable"
(more React elements, strings, `null`, numbers, etc.)

## Exercise

Production deploys:

- [Exercise](http://react-fundamentals.netlify.app/isolated/exercise/04.html)
- [Final](http://react-fundamentals.netlify.app/isolated/final/04.html)

Let's say the DOM we want to generate is like this:

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="message">Hello World</div>
  <div class="message">Goodbye World</div>
</div>
```

In this case, it would be cool if we could reduce the duplication for creating
the React elements for this:

```jsx
<div className="message">{children}</div>
```

So we need to make a function which accepts an object argument with a `children`
property and returns the React element. Then you can interpolate a call to that
function in your JSX.

```jsx
<div>{message({children: 'Hello World'})}</div>
```

This is not how we write custom React components, but this is important for you
to understand them. We'll get to custom components in the extra credit.

## Extra Credit

### 1. 💯 using a custom component with React.createElement

[Production deploy](http://react-fundamentals.netlify.app/isolated/final/04.extra-1.html)

So far we've only used `React.createElement(someString)`, but the first argument
to `React.createElement` can also be a function which returns something that's
renderable.

So instead of calling your `message` function, pass it as the first argument to
`React.createElement` and pass the `{children: 'Hello World'}` object as the
second argument.

### 2. 💯 using a custom component with JSX

[Production deploy](http://react-fundamentals.netlify.app/isolated/final/04.extra-2.html)

We're so close! Just like using JSX for regular `div`s is nicer than using the
raw `React.createElement` API, using JSX for custom components is nicer too.
Remember that it's Babel that's responsible for taking our JSX and compiling it
to `React.createElement` calls so we just need a way to tell Babel how to
compile our JSX so it passes the function by its name rather than a string.

We do this by how the JSX appears. Here are a few examples of Babel output for
JSX:

```javascript
ui = <Capitalized /> // React.createElement(Capitalized)
ui = <property.access /> // React.createElement(property.access)
ui = <Property.Access /> // React.createElement(Property.Access)
ui = <Property['Access'] /> // SyntaxError
ui = <lowercase /> // React.createElement('lowercase')
ui = <kebab-case /> // React.createElement('kebab-case')
ui = <Upper-Kebab-Case /> // React.createElement('Upper-Kebab-Case')
ui = <Upper_Snake_Case /> // React.createElement(Upper_Snake_Case)
ui = <lower_snake_case /> // React.createElement('lower_snake_case')
```

See if you can change your component function name so people can use it with JSX
more easily!

### 3. 💯 Runtime validation with PropTypes

[Production deploy](http://react-fundamentals.netlify.app/isolated/final/04.extra-3.html)

Let's change the Message component a little bit. Make it look like this now:

```javascript
function Message({subject, greeting}) {
  return (
    <div className="message">
      {greeting}, {subject}
    </div>
  )
}
```

So now we'll use it like this:

```javascript
<Message greeting="Hello" subject="World" />
<Message greeting="Goodbye" subject="World" />
```

What happens if I forget to pass the `greeting` or `subject` props? It's not
going to render properly. We'll end up with a dangling comma somewhere. It would
be nice if we got some sort of indication that we passed the wrong value to the
component. This is what the `propTypes` feature is for. Here's an example of how
you use `propTypes`:

```javascript
function FavoriteNumber({favoriteNumber}) {
  return <div>My favorite number is: {favoriteNumber}</div>
}

const PropTypes = {
  number(props, propName, componentName) {
    if (typeof props[propName] !== 'number') {
      return new Error('Some useful error message here')
    }
  },
}

FavoriteNumber.propTypes = {
  favoriteNumber: PropTypes.number,
}
```

With that, if I do this:

```javascript
<FavoriteNumber favoriteNumber="not a number" />
```

I'll get an error in the console.

For this extra credit, add `propTypes` support to your updated component
(remember to update it to have the subject and greeting).

🦉 Note that prop types validation add some runtime overhead resulting in
sub-optimal performance, so the validation functions are not run in production.

### 4. 💯 Use the prop-types package

[Production deploy](http://react-fundamentals.netlify.app/isolated/final/04.extra-4.html)

As it turns out, there are some pretty common things you'd want to validate, so
the React team maintains a package of these called
[`prop-types`](https://npm.im/prop-types). Go ahead and get that added to the
page by adding a script tag for it:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/prop-types@15.7.2/prop-types.js"></script>
```

Then use that package instead of writing it yourself. Also, make use of the
`isRequired` feature!

### 5. 💯 using React Fragments

[Production deploy](http://react-fundamentals.netlify.app/isolated/final/04.extra-5.html)

One feature of JSX that you'll find useful is called
["React Fragments"](https://reactjs.org/docs/fragments.html). It's a special
kind of component from React which allows you to position two elements
side-by-side rather than just nested.

The component is available via `<React.Fragment>` (or a
[short syntax](https://reactjs.org/docs/fragments.html#short-syntax) that opens
with `<>` and closes with `</>`). Replace the `<div className="container">` with
a fragment and inspect the DOM to notice that the elements are both rendered as
direct children of `root`.
